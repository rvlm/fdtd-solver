RVLM FDTD Solver Library
========================

(In early development.)

Runtime dependencies
--------------------

 1. NetCDF
 2. OpenCL

Developer's environment
-----------------------

In order to compile the library and participate in its development, you will
need the following additional software:

 1. C89-compliant compiler (GCC and Clang are fine)
 2. CMake
 3. CppCheck
 4. Valgrind
 5. CUnit
 6. Python (with Jinja2 package)

It's possible to compile the library without points 3â€“6, but any contributions
aren't going to be accepted if they aren't supplied with proper unit-tests
passing without memory leaks.
